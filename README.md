## About the Project <a name="heading-about-the-project"></a>

The project's scope involves creating a solution to enable colleagues to locate each other efficiently. This entails providing real-time information on whether a coworker is working at the office or remotely. When a colleague is at the office, it's crucial to determine their precise location, facilitating easy access for other team members. This location tracking can be achieved through methods like Wi-Fi signals or innovative solutions. Our core objective was to develop a comprehensive solution that addresses these needs by efficiently tracking office presence and remote work status, ensuring that colleagues can quickly and easily find each other, regardless of their work location.
